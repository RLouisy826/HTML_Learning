            <p>"Bears are large, carnivorous mammals found in various parts of the world. There are eight different species of bears, including the polar bear, brown bear, and black bear.
            Bears are known for their strength and agility, and are often depicted as fierce predators in popular culture.
            However, bears are generally shy and avoid humans, and attacks on humans are rare.
            Bears are important parts of their ecosystems and play important roles in seed dispersal and the maintenance of healthy forests. Some bear species, such as polar bears and pandas, are facing threats due to habitat loss and other human activities."</p>

    <img class="centered-pictures" src="bear-attack.jpg" alt="bear-attack">
    <p>Bear attacks are rare, but they can be serious and even deadly. 
      It is important to be cautious and aware of your surroundings when you are in bear country.</p>
      <p>If you encounter a bear, try to stay calm and do not approach it. </p>
      <p>Make yourself look as large as possible and make noise to let the bear know you are there. </p>
      <p>If the bear charges or attacks, use bear spray or another deterrent if you have it, and try to get away by backing away slowly. </p>
      <p>If the bear makes contact, fight back with any available objects or use your fists to hit the bear's face and muzzle. 
        It is important to remember that bears are wild animals and should be treated with respect and caution.</p>
      <p>There have been a total of 1,567 bear attacks in the United States between 1900 and 2021. Of these attacks, 696 resulted in injuries and 63 resulted in fatalities. </p>
      <p>The majority of bear attacks occurred in Alaska, where bears are more abundant and people are more likely to encounter them. The states with the next highest number of bear attacks were California, Colorado, and Montana. </p>
      <p>Most bear attacks occurred when bears were defending themselves or their food, or when people surprised or approached bears too closely. </p>
      <p>It is important to remember that bear attacks are rare, and can often be avoided by taking precautions such as making noise while hiking and storing food properly while camping.</p>

      <p>The Siberian bear hunting suit is a specialized piece of equipment used by hunters to protect themselves while hunting bears in Russia. 
        It is made of heavy-duty materials such as steel and kevlar, and is designed to withstand the claws and teeth of a bear. </p>
        <p>The suit includes a face shield and a thick layer of padding to protect the hunter's body.
