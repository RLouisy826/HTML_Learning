# HTML_Learning
Learning HTML together

This repository is shared between different people in order to learn HTML, CSS, JS and to learn cooperation whilst building a project.

To help others out in understanding your code and for the sake of learning to be more organized it would be nice for code writters to comment there own code, to help others figure out what you did for your project to work, it's not the most important thing but it's just nice.

The structure of the repo is as follows:
