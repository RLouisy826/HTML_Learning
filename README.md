# HTML_Learning

Learning HTML together

This repository is shared between different people in order to learn HTML, CSS, JS and to learn cooperation whilst building a project.

To help others out in understanding your code and for the sake of learning to be more organized it would be nice for code writters to comment there own code, to help others figure out what you did for your project to work, it's not the most important thing but it's just nice.

The structure of the repo is as follows:

### Remarks 
When prototyping, please build your project in a seperate folder, when complete we will all review it and then migrate it, using vite.

Since this project uses Vite.js it would be good to note that all the files should be in the 'public' folder when  they're ready to go live on Vercel.

Make sure all the paths are correctly set, and remember that the root directory when using Vite.js is the "public" folder so all the content must be routed to there instead in order for the links and other elements to work together
